# Spam SMS Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting spam SMS messages. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms, this project classifies SMS messages as either `spam` or `ham` (not spam).

## Project Overview

Spam SMS detection is a critical task in ensuring secure and clutter-free communication. This project uses a dataset of SMS messages and applies preprocessing techniques and classification models to achieve accurate predictions.

Key steps include:
1. Loading and exploring the SMS dataset.
2. Preprocessing the text data (e.g., tokenization, stop-word removal, etc.).
3. Building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Handles text cleaning and vectorization for machine learning models.
- **Model Training**: Implements machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or others for classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

## Dataset

The project uses a public SMS spam dataset. Each entry in the dataset includes:
- A label (`spam` or `ham`).
- The text of the SMS message.
